The application development will be developed using NextJs with a front end done using NextJS 13 and a backend which is a nodejs application connected to a MongoDB.  

To get started, we will install the following prerequisite. 

Then we will install the following NodeJS versions 

+ NodeJS 20.x.x
+ MongopDB - please use your own local version 
+ Visual Studio Code  for Front end development
+ Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 7 - for Backend development

Syncfusion will be installed using the npm and visual studio nuget automatically when you build the modules.

For database setup, when the IOT Web API Project starts up, it will connect to the MongoDb instance configured and create the default data.
This is under the Setup/SetupBase.cs file. 

To hide items from the theme - please do the following :

Example hide Setting popup
app/configs/themeConfig.js
- add new setting
    showSettings: false,
app/store/layoutReducer.js 
- add under initial state
  showSettings: themeConfig.layout.showSettings,
then in the class - example 
app/(dashboard}/layout.js
  const showSettings = useSelector((state) => state.layout.showSettings);
and you can show or hide things from there. 


For the navBar, i have made a file called navBarConfig in app/configs folder and i deployed it in components/partials/header/index.jsx - use this
